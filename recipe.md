First preheat your oven to 350 F (176 C).  
Start by creaming your butter and your white granulated or caster sugar together in a large bowl.Use a hand mixer or stand mixer to do this.
Now  add in  eggs one at a time. So drop one egg in, mix, once that egg is completely incorporated do the other egg. Make sure to scrape the sides of the bowl as well with a spatula
Now add in cocoa powder. It is a good idea to run it through some kind of a sifter. 
Then mix again and scrape the sides as needed. Throughout this whole process  don't want to over mix, just until things are incorporated.
Now add in your vanilla extract to your buttermilk as well as your white vinegar.
If you don't have buttermilk you can make some by taking just shy of one cup of regular milk andid adng one tablespoon of lemon juice or vinegar and then let it out to 15 minutes.
Stir in the vinegar and vanilla extract until combined.
Now  add in oil to the buttermilk mixture. 
Next add in about 2 to 2 and 1/2 Tablespoons of red food coloring liquid. 
Then stir, until the mixture is a nice red color. Set that mixture aside for now.
Next add salt and baking soda to our flour. You can use cake flour or all-purpose flour. Cake flour tends to work a little bit better, but all-purpose works great too. 
Use a whisk to combine those ingredients.
Now we just fill up two 9 inch or 8 inch cake pans with equal amounts of cake batter. Make sure to use shortening or kitchen spray on the pans and then dust them with cocoa powder.
Bake those cakes for 23 to 30 minutes until when a toothpick comes out clean after poking it in the middle.
Now after the cakes come out of the oven leave them alone and allow them to cool in their pans for about 10 minutes. 
After that remove them from their pans, remove the parchment paper and then let the cakes cool completely on the rack. 
Afterwards you can place the cakes in the fridge and let them chill, which helps with the frosting.
Now combine the cream cheese, butter, and vanilla extract into a large bowl and mix with a hand mixer until nice and smooth usually takes a few minutes. 
Then slowly incorporate all of the powdered sugar. You may need more or less depending on the consistency that you want.
Next just remove the beaters.
Frosting is ready to go. At this point if the frosting is still too runny add more powdered sugar, or just chill it for about 30 minutes before frosting that cake.
